Apple's Mac Computers (MacBook, iMac and Mac Pro) are currently running on
Intel Processors which is going to be changed to run on in-house ARM processors.
By this change Apple can deliver higher security, stability, performance and
lesser power consumption with in-house ARM processors.

## History of Mac Computers
Mac Computer was first launched in 1990 and it served three decades to the
human mankind for personal computing needs, and it evolved to various kind of
Mac Computers like Mac Pro, iMac and Macbook to suit the human needs. Initially
in 1990 Mac started its journey with Motorola Processors, later in 1995 it
jumps to IBM's PowerPC and after a decade (in 2005) it jumps to intel x86.
Today in 2020 after 3 decades it jumps to ARM processors.

## One App to run on iPhone, iPad and Mac
By this move, Apple claims that most of the iPhone and iPad App will run
smoothly on Mac with ARM chips. And Apple user no need to purchase two
flavours of a same app for iPhone/iPad and Mac. This reduces burden on app
developers as well who develop apps on all the 3 types of Apple products
(iPhone, iPad and Mac).
And also apps which are currently exist only on iPhone/iPad and does not exist
on Mac platform will also be used on Mac devices in future.

## Rosetta 2
Existing x86 based Mac Apps can be **installed on ARM based Mac with the help of
Rosetta 2**. This gives breathing time for app developers to migrate from x86
to ARM based environment by retaining users. First version of Rosetta was used
by Apple in 2005 when it migrates its Mac product lines from PPC to Intel.

## Mac App Store
By this move, Apple will achive all Mac Apps distribute under **Mac App Store**.
Currently that is not the case for Mac device Apps. That means currently
App developers can distribute the Apps by themself to Mac products. But
in future it will not be the case. **All Mac App developers should distribute
the apps via Apple's Mac App Store**. Similar to iPhone and iPad App Stores.
And this will allows apple to get
a slice of revenue from Commercial Mac Apps and also it will be able to
control the boundaries of App. Some of the App developers will hesitate to
accept this. But no way other than accepting it if they want to support
Apps on future Mac products.

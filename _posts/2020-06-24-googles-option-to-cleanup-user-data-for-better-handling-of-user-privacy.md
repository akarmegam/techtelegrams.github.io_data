So far every Google user is concerned about the data (Search history, Location,
etc) collected by Google for providing future recommendations about related
News, Videos, Ads, Products etc. Now Google has finally reacted for this user
concern with a solution of **clearing the collected User Activity Data after
certain months** by default.

Google's new default policies to cleanup of User Data are
- **Web & App Acitvity**: By default cleans 18 months old Search history on
Search engine and Apps. User can reduce this to even 3 months and also clear
it manually
anytime.
- **Location History**: By default cleans 18 months old location history
collected from Google Maps. User can reduce this to 3 months. And more
importantly user can **completely disable location history data collection**.
- **Youtube History**: By default cleans 36 months old Search history on
Youtube. User can reduce this to even 3 months or 18 months.

To configure above 3 User Privacy settings on Google account, user has to visit
`Data & personalization` in Google Account settings. Note that for **existing
Google users by default settings of above 3 options are "Don't Auto Delete",
so existing user should visit "Data & personalization" in Google Account
settings to change this**. But for new Google Account users from now on, it
will be by default cleanup after above mentioned months.

## Disabling Location History
Disabling Google Maps and other services to collect location history
are available in Google Accounts. We all still remember the Google'S CEO
discussion with USA congressman, in which one of the hot question thrown on
Google CEO was **Does google track my location with this mobile phone ?**. And
CEO's response was **That is based on the services activated on Google
account**.
Yes most of us worry about our location privacy, as google tracks where and all
I roam. Google's solution to that is disabling `Location History` option
in Google's account. This is one of the most important setting user should
do who worries about location privacy details.

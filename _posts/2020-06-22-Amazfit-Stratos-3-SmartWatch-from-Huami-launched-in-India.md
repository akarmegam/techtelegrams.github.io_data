## Wearable Device Market in India
So far the 95% of Smart Phone users are staying away from Smart Wearable, mainly
because the value user gets out of it is not commendable for the price. Because
most of the Smart Phone users are using mid range Smart phones (10000 to 20000
INR). And spending almost same amount as Smart Phone on Smart Wearable needs
a noticable value other than Step Counts. Because even Smart Phone App can
count the steps which user makes. Indian Smart Phone users are reluctant to put
same amount (10000 to 20000 INR) on wearables for monitoring sleep, heart rate
and physical activity.

In Indian competitive market
to reach more customer, a Wearable OEM should come with the price tag half of
the mid range Smart Phone price (roughly 5000 to 10000 INR) with good set
of physical activity monitoring. And also other than physical activity tracking
app, much more apps support should come to Wearable OS. For example,
- A news app which pops and displays news based on user subscribed categories.
- Cab booking app integration.
- Online Wallets QR code for receiving money. So that user can show his Wallet
QR code to sender without taking out his phone.
- Even QR code scanning with a camera on Wearable.

Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic gives a warning statement that fitness is the key
to survival against such virus attack against human mankind. So to keep fit 
more and more people will start practicing physical activity on regular
basis that also will boost Wearable device sales in India in upcoming years.

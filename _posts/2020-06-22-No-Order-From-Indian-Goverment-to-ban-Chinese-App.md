A viral memo from NIC (National Informatics Centre) circulating on Indian
social media which states that Government placed an order to ban Chinese
Apps on Google play store and Apple App Store. **This is fake news**. PIB
(Press Information Bureau) an Indian government agency announced this
as fake memo. This has been anounced by PIB on its official twitter handle
[PIBFactCheck](https://twitter.com/PIBFactCheck/status/1273923942349041664).

## People should avoid forwarding unauthentic message
Recently these kind of fake news spreading with digital letter format of
Indian Government and also with Government authority signature is quite
common in India. On social media if anyone receives it, immediately it gets
forwarded without verifying the authenticity of the news. It is unethical
behaviour of an Indian Citizen. Receiving legitimate news from authentic News
agency should be trusted and forwarded on social media.

## Don't Trust without verifying
In this digital world lot of rumours can be spread by timepassers in social
media (like Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to get more likes
and follows. As an India Citizen any such message
received on social media should not be trusted until unless it is
cross verified with authentic News forums.

Beware of such fake news.
